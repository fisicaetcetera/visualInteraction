# visualInteraction
user can control execution through video capture
The code follows the nose of the user, to detect when the user 
bow his head.  If nodding is detected, the person, who was in a 2D space
and spinning, ceases the spin and returns to the real place where she;he was.
(in the video, of course.)  Only a small nod is necessary.
I do not know how to turn of the video capture.
I plan to include a sound file that tells the user what to do to be freed.
